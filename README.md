# Coronavirus_Pretest_Probability
This file is an attempt to determine the pre-test and post-test probability of a positive covid test based on regional data and symptoms. As input it requires a time, a location, and a factor that applys to a percentage of the people living at that time and location. It's output is the Pre-test Probability, Sensitivity, Specificity, Sensitivity + Specificity, the probability of getting a true positive result (based on Pre-test Probability, Sensitivity, and Specificity), and the probability of getting a false negative result (based on Pre-test Probability, Sensitivity, and Specificity), as well as a chart that illustrates where Pre-test Probability intercepts the probability of getting a true positive or negative result. Based on these outputs it is possible to determine if a factor could be used to accurately pretest for covid.
